# Hi there ‚úåÔ∏è

This is **Pradeep Gowda**.

This is the perfect place to talk about programming and stuff ;)

- I like programming in: Python, Nim, and Scala
- I have programmed professionally in: Java, Javascript, Bash
- I have done non-trivial amounts of programming in: Erlang, Rust, D, C, C++, Lua
- I want to get good in: OCaml (or F#), Nix, and Go
- Languages I wish I could be programming: Common Lisp, APL, and FORTH
- My most recent professional experience is in leading and writing code on development teams in the cybersecurity engineering domain while solving for large scale data gathering, processing and producing data products

These are some of my links related to programming:

## Recent Projects

- Aug 2024. [Simplestatapp](//github.com/btbytes/simplestatapp), a demonstrative example of how to build a *tiny* (by modern standards),
a standalone web application that has database support etc for under 6MB, and can be deployed
to a PaaS provider like Fly.io. This one helped me understand C compiler and linkers a bit better.
- Aug 2024. [Tohray](https://github.com/btbytes/tohray), A microblogging application in Nim. This helped me
learn Nim as a practical language, prologue web framework, multi-stage docker builds etc..
- Apr 2024. [Pandaku](https://github.com/btbytes/pandaku), a [fly.io](https://fly.io) deployment of [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) API. Has Docker, Fly configs, and example code on how to use the API

## Recent Learning

- Sep 2024. [Ulimate Rust Crash Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/)
- Sep 2024. I also learnt Next.js fundamentals while doing a take-home exercise for a job interview.

## Recent Hacks

- Aug 2024. I used Claude 3.5 Sonnet to write a MacOS Automator script to convert `.png/.jpg` etc to a smaller sized, web optimized `.webp`
format. I'm really thrilled that I was able to go from having to use command line, (and context switching)
to something I can do in the Finder. In this case, Claude was acting [as my tutor](https://www.btbytes.com/posts/use-of-llms-for-programming.html), and I learnt something new.
You can [see my thread on X](https://x.com/btbytes/status/1821729486913626476) on how it all went down; and the resulting MacOS workflow [is here on github](https://github.com/btbytes/Convert-To-WebP-Workflow).
